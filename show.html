                        Togenashi Togeari signs a contract with Shiomi Miura's agency. They quit their part-time jobs and spend the days at a studio working on their first professional song. <br><br>
                        
                        An offer comes from Diamond Dust to jointly promote a set of two concerts. It will be bad for them if they can't draw a good-sized crowd. After much discussion they agree.

                        The battle of the bands is not going well for Togenashi Togeari. While Diamond Dust has sold out their concert, TogeToge is only around 30%. Shiomi goes to Diamond Dust's agency to ask for help. They come up with an arrangement in which Diamond Dust will play at the Togenashi Togeari concert in order to boost ticket sales. Hina drops by to see Nina. Hina is all smug and condescending and says that Nina should apologize and admit to being wrong, including about what happened at school. This doesn't set off Nina's anger response, but she complains to her band about how it makes her feel to bow her head to Diamond Dust. <br> <br>
                        
                        They decide to decline the double-bill arrangement. Furthermore, they break the contract with the agency and become an indie band again. Momoka later suggests that Hina didn't want to see Togenashi Togeari become a pop band and goaded Nina into doing this. They perform solo to a small crowd.

                    Toei Animation's involvement in the creation, planning, and production of this project comes as a surprise to both industry professionals and fans. The company has primarily focused on producing content for families and children, with limited works catering to young adults, music, idols, and similar genres. This venture represents a new challenge for them.
